# VeriNews

VeriNews is a Streamlit-based fake news detection app powered by a fine-tuned RoBERTa model.  
It predicts whether a news article is real or fake and helps with verification by surfacing live reference content from the web.

## Model

- Base model: `RoBERTa-base` from Hugging Face Transformers
- Fine-tuned on:
	- LIAR
	- ISOT
	- WELFake

## Features

- Clean web interface built with Streamlit
- RoBERTa-based real/fake classification
- Support for multiple fake-news datasets
- Live reference content retrieval for verification

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvrajpinkman/VeriNews.git
cd VeriNews
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
# Python 3.10+ is required
python -m venv roberta-env

# Windows PowerShell
roberta-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up Hugging Face credentials

The app automatically loads the fine-tuned model from Hugging Face. Add your Hugging Face token to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
HF_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_token_here"
```

Get your token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes

- The fine-tuned RoBERTa model is hosted on Hugging Face: [singhyuvraj999/Roberta_FineTuned](https://huggingface.co/singhyuvraj999/Roberta_FineTuned)
- If you prefer to use a locally downloaded model instead, follow the instructions in [Model.md](Model.md).
- If PowerShell blocks activation scripts, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
